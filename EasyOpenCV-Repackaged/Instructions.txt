Install EasyOpenCV Dependency
Since FTCLib depends on EasyOpenCV for vision, and because EasyOpenCV depends on OpenCV-Repackaged (https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenCV-Repackaged), you will need to copy libOpenCvAndroid453.so (https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenCV-Repackaged/tree/9a4d3d4bc001feffb3767842fa2de0c38a98883a/doc/native_libs/armeabi-v7a) into the FIRST folder of the Robot Controller (i.e. connect the Robot Controller to your computer with a USB cable, put it into MTP mode, and drag 'n drop the file).
